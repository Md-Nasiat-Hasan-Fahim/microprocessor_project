<h1 align="center">An Integrated Eco-System to use AI for mass Bengali people</h1>

<h4 align="center">In an era where Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing global sectors, Bangladesh faces unique challenges in harnessing its full potential. Our project aims to break down the language barrier that prevents many Bengali speakers, especially those with limited English proficiency, from accessing and benefiting from AI technologies.</h4>
<br>
<h2 align="left">Our Vision</h2>
<p>We're developing an integrated eco-system that brings AI to the masses in Bangladesh:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Voice-Assisted AI in Bengali:</strong> An end-to-end Bangla voice assistance system that allows interaction with AI products without requiring English knowledge.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Inclusivity:</strong> Focusing on accessibility for all, including the poor, uneducated, and differently-abled.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Practical Applications:</strong> Demonstrating real-world use cases, such as empowering visually impaired individuals with cost-effective digital solutions.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<p>By leveraging open-source AI resources and adapting them for Bengali speakers, we're not just translating technology â€“ we're transforming lives. Our system aims to democratize AI access, bringing Bangladesh closer to realizing its 'Smart Bangladesh' vision.
Join us in this journey to make AI accessible to every Bengali speaker, regardless of their background or abilities. Together, we can ensure that language is no longer a barrier to progress in the AI age.</p>


<h2>How are we going to achieve:</h2>
<p></p>We want to develop an end-to-end Bangla voice assistance system using existing models and research. With the help of this system, people with zero to minimal English knowledge can interact with products that previously required English for interaction.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>We will demonstrate one of the many use cases of our developed system by implementing it for blind people in Bangladesh. In the context of developing nations like Bangladesh, there is a lack of adequate facilities to address and enhance the conditions of visually impaired individuals. Our aim is to develop a comprehensive system utilizing cost-effective and readily available digital integrated technology, designed to empower blind or partially blind individuals in carrying out their daily tasks with little to no assistance from others.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Language or technical barriers shouldn't hinder progress in the age of AI. We must actively participate in the revolution using our Bengali resources and leverage open-source foreign AI resources. Our system will make it easy for the mass Bengali population, regardless of their background, to join this journey and bring Bangladesh a step closer to a 'Smart Bangladesh'.</p>
